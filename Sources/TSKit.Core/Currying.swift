/// Curries a function with two arguments into a sequence of partial functions.

/// Currying is the technique of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each takes a single argument.
/// For example, currying a function `f` that takes two arguments `(a, b)`
/// ```
/// func f(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int
/// ```
/// creates a sequence of three functions `r(a)(b)`.
/// - Returns: A curried function `r(a)(b)` that expects the first argument of the initial function.
